# LibreTasks

LibreTasks automates your Android device by triggering actions based on configurable events.

For example, you may pause your media when your charger is disconnected, or turn off wifi at a certain time of day.

LibreTasks is a fork of [Omnidroid](http://code.google.com/p/omnidroid "Omnidroid") with new features.
